# Word Counter
Simple aplication which counts the number of ords, spaces and letters in the pasted text.
The app splits input text by whitespaces and then aplies a set of predefined checking functions to those words;
they determine whether the set of character can be considered a separate word.
All checks done mostly by the use of regular expressions.
